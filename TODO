S C O P  S C O P E :

ability to lock on a gameobject (camera rotates around it)

test the parsing (multiple objects, no objects... etc)
IMPORTANT : algo to sort the vertices and indices (eventually i would like to just indicate order with mouse drag or whatever)
IMPORTANT : Drawcall analysis (slider shows each primitive being renderered)

remove this file before finishing the project
remove .vscode before finishing the project
remove display.c
remove stash folder with everything it contains

libmath is not clean (norminette, unixcase...)
norminette on all (EVERYTHING)
check 42 headers
check scop LEAKS (try different setup interruptions...)
check everything

SELECTION BUFFER -> one color associated with every object for selection picking
SERIALIZATION !

* close button triggers SDL_QUIT ðŸ¤  event
* import button for .obj files with import flags/toggles -> texture, material, animation, rigging, normals etc.
* input handler !
* showFPS
* float field and toggle for fps capping (e.g. toggle[/] and [60fps])
* handles (scene axes and grid, objects local/world coordinates (switch), rotation handles, scale handles, position handles)
all sorts of handles and gizmos.

object basic info when hovering over it.

O U T  O F  S C O P E :

* error logger (console log "pops" up when there is a debug/erro)
-> it's like a sidebar on top of the folder window, that slides up (you can lock it to keep it docked, small notifications as exclamation mark)

* vector / math libraries in c++ with operators lh +(rh) lh =(rh)
* 3d textures and tetrahedrons eventually

gameObject = { rendering properties, physics properties, audio properties, behaviour(s), matter properties etc. };
